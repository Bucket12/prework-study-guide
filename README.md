# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

As I began my journey into coding, I realized there would be too much information to simply remember. At this point I knew I needed a study guide and using the tools provided in the Prework modules I was able to do just that. Through creating this study guide, I 
have learned to use HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Using these tools I have created a website to help keep track of the notes I may need during my time in the Bootcamp and this will be used to help be successful during and after the Bootcamp.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of 
the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
